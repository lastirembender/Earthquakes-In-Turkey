Many people passed away because of disasters in the world. Flood, avalanche, cyclone and many others... In Turkey, frequency of natural disaster can change to regions but earthquake almost every regions problem. Every year, many earthquakes of different intensities occur. Subject of this project is "Earthquakes in Turkey" 

## Data

In this project, I used the dataset in the link for data visualization. I would like to thank the dataset owner and Boğaziçi University Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute for creating the dataset.

## Data Visualization

I used [**Power BI**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) for data visualization because Power BI is easy to use, useful, strong and a very good software in terms of graphics variety. While using this software you can use data from many sources and present your data by visualizing it the way you want.

- This chart shows earthquakes in 2020, indicated by size and location. 

- This chart uses a theme specially designed for colorblind people, which is one of the themes in Power BI.

- These charts represent (upper left) the distribution of the total number of earthquakes experienced in the last 100 years according to their magnitudes, (lower left) the distribution of the depths of earthquakes by years, (right) the distribution of the number of earthquakes experienced in the last 100 years by years.
