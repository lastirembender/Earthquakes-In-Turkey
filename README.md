Many people passed away because of disasters in the world. Flood, avalanche, cyclone and many others... In Turkey, frequency of natural disaster can change to regions but earthquake almost every regions problem. Every year, many earthquakes of different intensities occur. Subject of this project is "Earthquakes in Turkey"

## Data Visualization

I used [**Power BI**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) for data visualization because Power BI is easy to use, useful, strong and a very good software in terms of graphics variety. While using this software you can use data from many sources and present your data by visualizing it the way you want.
